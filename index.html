  &gt; Polarization refers to the orientation of the plane in which the transmitted electromagnetic wave oscillates. While the orientation can occur at any angle, SAR sensors typically transmit linearly polarized. The horizontal polarization is indicated by the letter H, and the vertical polarization is indicated by V.

Different surfaces respond differently to the polarizations

The colourful areas are the rice growing areas, where the landcovers change rapidly during the rice season. The greyish linear features are the more permanent trees lining the canals. The grey patch near the bottom of the image is wetland forest. The two towns appear as bright white spots in this image.

# SAR background 4

Some terms:   

&gt; Backscatter is the portion of the outgoing radar signal that the target redirects directly back towards the radar antenna

The higher the backscattered intensity = rougher the surface. It is "unitless"

Can be converted to "backscatter coefficient, or sigma nought", measured in decibel (dB) units = normalised measure of the radar return from a distributed target 

If the signal is from backscatter is not desired = "clutter"

* Has been used in urban monitoring BUT...

  * Corner reflections in urban environments 
  * Shadowing - building behind another not imaged 
  * Speckle - grainy, from scattering on ground - "salt and pepper"

  * VV = surface roughness
  * VH = volume of surface (e.g. vegetation has a complex volume and can change the polarization)

* Permativity (dielectric constant) - how **reflective** is the property which means **reflective back to the sensor**. Water usually reflects it off elsewhere

# Me on SAR

&gt; Although SAR images over urban areas provide low quality images due to problems associated with radar imaging in such an environment (i.e. multiple bouncing, layover and shadowing), SAR texture measures can provide valuable information in discerning urban areas (Dell’Acqua et al., 2003; Zhu et al., 2012). Isolated scattering of residential areas and crowded backscatters of inner city high density areas permit classification refinement, thus textural measures such as those descried within the spatial domain can aid identification of alternative urban forms (Zhu et al., 2012). 

&gt;However, the lack of freely available SAR data that temporally coincides with other satellite imagery (e.g. Landsat) frequently precludes extensive use

# InSAR

Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR)
 * Take two RADAR observations of the target (e.g. the ground)
 * Use the phase difference 
 * Phase = 
  &gt; "total number of cycles of the wave at any given distance from the transmitter, including the fractional part"

* Phase difference - SUBTRACT the values (measured phase values) at two different measurement points

* Differential distance depends on the height of the terrain (topography)

* Used for creating DEMs

* Monitoring displacement of ground - earthquakes etc

  &gt;  Coherence is defined as the degree of similarity of backscattering response (or reflection characteristic of as measured by the SAR sensor) between corresponding ground cells in both SAR image of an InSAR pair. 
  
  &gt; Something is coherent when they are in phase (vibrate in unison)

**Sensor**

* Landsat (2000 to 2012)

Monitoring forest loss and illegal logging 

* Pre-processing

&gt; "Landsat pre-processing steps included: (i) image resampling, (ii) conversion of raw
digital values (DN) to top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, (iii) cloud/shadow/water
screening and quality assessment (QA), and (iv) image normalization"

&gt; The stack of QA layers was used to create a perpixel set of cloud-free image observations which in turn was employed to calculate timeseries spectral metrics.

# Monitoring forests + illegal logging 2

* Creating metrics

&gt; Metrics represent a generic feature space that facilitates regionalscale mapping and have been used extensively with MODIS and AVHRR data

&gt; (i) reflectance values representing maximum, minimum and selected percentile values 
  (ii) mean reflectance values for observations between selected percentiles
  (iii) slope of linear regression of band reflectance value versus
image date.

In support of this reference is given to [Hansen et al. 2010](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.0912668107)...supplementary material...

&gt; The time-sequential MODIS 32-dayinputs were transformed to annual metrics to produce a more generalized feature space

# Monitoring forests + illegal logging 6

&gt; Decision trees are hierarchical classifiers that predict class membership by recursively partitioning a data set into more homogeneous or less varying subsets, referred to as nodes

* A random forest classifier is a collection of decision trees

* Take something complex and force into many decisions = if-else conditions or also called divide and conquer.

* Often requires hyperparameters to train the model (or  control the learning process) - e.g. the choices we've made in the past...sort of...
  * DBSCAN (radius of points, Epsilon or MinPts - to make a cluster)
  * Spatial weight matrix (type and then weight)

* Split the data into more and more homogeneous subsets (filtering!) this can be limited through
  * pre-pruning - set a number of iterations before
  * post-pruning - reduce groups afterwards based on accuracy. Tree fully grows but will be overfit.

**Post pruning**

In post-pruning first, it goes deeper and deeper in the tree to build a complete tree. If the tree shows the overfitting problem then pruning is done as a post-pruning step. We use a cross-validation data to check the effect of our pruning. **Using cross-validation data, it tests whether expanding a node will make an improvement or not**. If it shows an improvement, then we can continue by expanding that node. But if it shows a reduction in accuracy then it should not be expanded i.e, the node should be converted to a leaf node.

  Used:
  * **Sensor** Landsat TM 1984
  * vegetation, elevation, slope, aspect and road/ house proxmity = fire hazard map compared to burned map from Landsat
  * Did a weighted overlay of the layers - giving hazard value of 0 to 255, some layers had assigned values (e.g. aspect of 90-180 a value of 0)
  * Vegetation was from a classified Landsat TM image - classified 16 categories 
  * No accuracy assessment

# Combining this into a model...

[**Modeling the relationships between historical redlining, urban heat, and heat-related emergency department visits: An examination of 11 Texas cities**, Li et al. 2022](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23998083211039854)

Data:

* Red lined districts .shp (more on this in future lecture)
* Social vulnerability factors from American community survey: population aged 65 and older, non-White population, Hispanic population, lower-income population, individuals living alone, and populations who do not speak English well.
  * Normalised by population
* Visit to emergency departments for heat related illness
* LST data from the ECO2LSTE product within the 1 June and 31 August 2018–2020 window
  * **One daytime and one nighttime imagery set** with best quality flags were selected for each city (Figure 2), and summary measures such as mean daytime/nighttime LST, minimum daytime/nighttime LST, and maximum daytime/nighttime LST were determined with reference to ZCTA boundaries

## Not clear what a set is ?

# Combining this into a model...2

Methods:

* spatial autoregressive model (SAR) instead
  * this means models that contain geogrpahic areas like... Lag and error model
  * this means spatial regression!
  * recall from [CASA0005](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0005repo/explaining-spatial-patterns.html)
      * lag = include values of near by polygons
      * error = residuals of values in near polygons

Modelling:

* LST
* heat-related ED visits

Output:

* "these results suggest that inequalities in urban heat island conditions exist not only between the historically defined redlined and non-redlined zones but also between contemporary geographic units that contain more versus fewer historically redlined areas."

class: center, middle

## Refresher...

## In what circumstance might we use a spatial regression model?

## Where are residuals (errors) in linear regression are spatially autocorrelated (e.g. from Moran's I telling us how similar nearby objects our based on a weight matrix)

# The key
.pull-left[

* The key is *usually* **combining the remote sensing data** with GIS or other datasets to answer questions

* The remotely sensed data is consistent over days, months and years

* Often papers don't:
  * Link to population / people
  * Say how we can inform policy...

]

.pull-right[
**For example**
* Where should initiatives be targeted for reducing air pollution
* What areas / population are most at risk from forest fires or where should remediation be targeted 
* How can illegal monitoring be most effectively stopped

]
---

# The key in detail..

&gt; Our findings suggest that these challenges are distributed unevenly, and that historically redlined neighborhoods bear a disproportionately heavy burden. Existing heat-hazard prevention and mitigation plans are mostly based on entire region or city-level conditions, **while few policies and initiatives pay attention to the inequalities rooted in long-standing spatial patterns of disinvestment and segregation in cities**. Understanding how disparities in heat-related health conditions may have emerged through historical housing segregation can focus attention and resources on redressing these structural inequalities

Questions / critical reflection: 

* If i am a city planner how can we start to address this
* What areas should i start with (funding often limited)
* What stage in the planning process might this come
* Who would be responsible (e.g. what department)
* What skills do they need
* What benefits can this bring to the city (often finances!)
* How does this help the city align with global agendas
* What stakeholders do i need to consider

---

# The key in detail..

Often these considerations and questions are easily achievable from the data we have...

For example...

* The regression models will have produced Coefficient estimates 

  * They represent a one unit change in the independent (`\(x\)`) represents a drop or rise in dependent (`\(y\)`) - note this study didn't show this.
  * In spatial regression we can also compute direct and indirect effects due to the lag
  * We will have the spatial data for these variables....that we can map ...

* We also have the Coefficient t-value:

  * greater the relative effect that particular independent variable is having on the dependent variable

# Local policy documents

In most of the previous examples the documents were created by the metropolitan government:
  * Greater London Authority 
  * Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation
  * City of New York

Usually these are considered an upper tier

They set the strategic plan for the city and may have other responsibilities such as fire, policing, transport and development guidelines.

Lower tier government then carries out or adheres to these goals, for example....

* The Western Australian Planning Commission sets the statutory planning guidance that is carried out by local cities, such as the City of Perth and City of Fremantle.

* The Greater London Authority set the strategic goals for London with London Boroughs providing local services.
