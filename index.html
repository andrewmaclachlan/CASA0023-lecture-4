- Pressing the letter `o` (for overview) will allow you to see an overview of the whole presentation and go to a slide

- Alternatively just typing the slide number e.g. 10 on the website will take you to that slide

- Pressing alt+F will fit the slide to the screen, this is useful if you have resized the window and have another open - side by side.

  * Also different ploarizations - orientation of the plane in which EMR waves transmitted..
  
  &gt; Polarization refers to the orientation of the plane in which the transmitted electromagnetic wave oscillates. While the orientation can occur at any angle, SAR sensors typically transmit linearly polarized. The horizontal polarization is indicated by the letter H, and the vertical polarization is indicated by V.

Different surfaces respond differently to the polarizations

* Rough scattering (e.g. bare earth) = most sensitive to VV
* Volume scattering (e.g. leaves) = cross, VH or HV
* Double bounce (e.g. trees / buildings) = most sensitive to HH.

The colourful areas are the rice growing areas, where the landcovers change rapidly during the rice season. The greyish linear features are the more permanent trees lining the canals. The grey patch near the bottom of the image is wetland forest. The two towns appear as bright white spots in this image.

# SAR background 4

Some terms:   

&gt; Backscatter is the portion of the outgoing radar signal that the target redirects directly back towards the radar antenna

The higher the backscattered intensity = rougher the surface. It is "unitless"

Can be converted to "backscatter coefficient, or sigma nought", measured in decibel (dB) units = normalised measure of the radar return from a distributed target 

If the signal is from backscatter is not desired = "clutter"

* Has been used in urban monitoring BUT...

  * Corner reflections in urban environments 
  * Shadowing - building behind another not imaged 
  * Speckle - grainy, from scattering on ground - "salt and pepper"

** Backscatter (amplitude)**

* Polarization

  * VV = surface roughness
  * VH = volume of surface (e.g. vegetation has a complex volume and can change the polarization)

* Permativity (dielectric constant) - how **reflective** is the property which means **reflective back to the sensor**. Water usually reflects it off elsewhere

* The return **value**, also remember the band (wavelength)

# Me on SAR

&gt; Although SAR images over urban areas provide low quality images due to problems associated with radar imaging in such an environment (i.e. multiple bouncing, layover and shadowing), SAR texture measures can provide valuable information in discerning urban areas (Dell’Acqua et al., 2003; Zhu et al., 2012). Isolated scattering of residential areas and crowded backscatters of inner city high density areas permit classification refinement, thus textural measures such as those descried within the spatial domain can aid identification of alternative urban forms (Zhu et al., 2012). 

&gt;However, the lack of freely available SAR data that temporally coincides with other satellite imagery (e.g. Landsat) frequently precludes extensive use

# InSAR

Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR)
 * Take two RADAR observations of the target (e.g. the ground)
 * Use the phase difference 
 * Phase = 
  &gt; "total number of cycles of the wave at any given distance from the transmitter, including the fractional part"

* Phase difference - SUBTRACT the values (measured phase values) at two different measurement points

* Differential distance depends on the height of the terrain (topography)

* Used for creating DEMs

* Monitoring displacement of ground - earthquakes etc

# InSAR 2

Key terms

* Coherence Map

  &gt;  Coherence is defined as the degree of similarity of backscattering response (or reflection characteristic of as measured by the SAR sensor) between corresponding ground cells in both SAR image of an InSAR pair. 
  
  &gt; Something is coherent when they are in phase (vibrate in unison)

* Differential Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) - more on this later
  
&gt; "quantification of the ground displacement that occurred between the two acquisitions can be achieved" through a "differential interferogram"

# Monitoring forests + illegal logging 

**Sensor**

* Landsat (2000 to 2012)

Monitoring forest loss and illegal logging 

* Pre-processing

&gt; "Landsat pre-processing steps included: (i) image resampling, (ii) conversion of raw
digital values (DN) to top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, (iii) cloud/shadow/water
screening and quality assessment (QA), and (iv) image normalization"

&gt; The stack of QA layers was used to create a perpixel set of cloud-free image observations which in turn was employed to calculate timeseries spectral metrics.

---

# Monitoring forests + illegal logging 2

* Creating metrics

&gt; Metrics represent a generic feature space that facilitates regionalscale mapping and have been used extensively with MODIS and AVHRR data

&gt; (i) reflectance values representing maximum, minimum and selected percentile values 
  (ii) mean reflectance values for observations between selected percentiles
  (iii) slope of linear regression of band reflectance value versus
image date.

In support of this reference is given to [Hansen et al. 2010](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.0912668107)...supplementary material...

&gt; The time-sequential MODIS 32-dayinputs were transformed to annual metrics to produce a more generalized feature space

# Monitoring forests + illegal logging 3

# Monitoring forests + illegal logging 6

&gt; Decision trees are hierarchical classifiers that predict class membership by recursively partitioning a data set into more homogeneous or less varying subsets, referred to as nodes

* A random forest classifier is a collection of decision trees

* Take something complex and force into many decisions = if-else conditions or also called divide and conquer.

* Often requires hyperparameters to train the model (or  control the learning process) - e.g. the choices we've made in the past...sort of...
  * DBSCAN (radius of points, Epsilon or MinPts - to make a cluster)
  * Spatial weight matrix (type and then weight)

* Split the data into more and more homogeneous subsets (filtering!) this can be limited through
  * pre-pruning - set a number of iterations before
  * post-pruning - reduce groups afterwards based on accuracy. Tree fully grows but will be overfit.

Data:

* Red lined districts .shp (more on this in future lecture)
* Social vulnerability factors from American community survey: population aged 65 and older, non-White population, Hispanic population, lower-income population, individuals living alone, and populations who do not speak English well.
  * Normalised by population
* Visit to emergency departments for heat related illness
* LST data from the ECO2LSTE product within the 1 June and 31 August 2018–2020 window
  * **One daytime and one nighttime imagery set** with best quality flags were selected for each city (Figure 2), and summary measures such as mean daytime/nighttime LST, minimum daytime/nighttime LST, and maximum daytime/nighttime LST were determined with reference to ZCTA boundaries

# Combining this into a model...2

Methods:

  * this means spatial regression!
  * recall from [CASA0005](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0005repo/explaining-spatial-patterns.html)
      * lag = include values of near by polygons
      * error = residuals of values in near polygons

Modelling:

* LST
* heat-related ED visits

Output:

* "these results suggest that inequalities in urban heat island conditions exist not only between the historically defined redlined and non-redlined zones but also between contemporary geographic units that contain more versus fewer historically redlined areas."

## Where are residuals (errors) in linear regression are spatially autocorrelated (e.g. from Moran's I telling us how similar nearby objects our based on a weight matrix)

---

# The key
.pull-left[

* The key is *usually* **combining the remote sensing data** with GIS or other datasets to answer questions

* The remotely sensed data is consistent over days, months and years

* Often papers don't:
  * Link to population / people
  * Say how we can inform policy...

]

.pull-right[
**For example**
* Where should initiatives be targeted for reducing air pollution
* What areas / population are most at risk from forest fires or where should remediation be targeted 
* How can illegal monitoring be most effectively stopped

]
---

# The key in detail..

&gt; Our findings suggest that these challenges are distributed unevenly, and that historically redlined neighborhoods bear a disproportionately heavy burden. Existing heat-hazard prevention and mitigation plans are mostly based on entire region or city-level conditions, while few policies and initiatives pay attention to the inequalities rooted in long-standing spatial patterns of disinvestment and segregation in cities. Understanding how disparities in heat-related health conditions may have emerged through historical housing segregation can focus attention and resources on redressing these structural inequalities

Questions / critical reflection: 

* If i am a city planner how can we start to address this
* What areas should i start with (funding often limited)
* What stage in the planning process might this come
* Who would be responsible (e.g. what department)
* What skills do they need
* What benefits can this bring to the city (often finances!)
* How does this help the city align with global agendas
* What stakeholders do i need to consider

---

# The key in detail..

Often these considerations and questions are easily achievable from the data we have...

For example...

* The regression models will have produced Coefficient estimates 

  * They represent a one unit change in the independent represents a drop or rise in dependent (note this study didn't show this)
  * In spatial regression we can also compute direct and indirect effects due to the lag
  * We will have the spatial data for these variables....that we can map ...

* We also have the Coefficient t-value:

  * greater the relative effect that particular independent variable is having on the dependent variable

An example of commitments... Environmentally sustainable and resilient urban development subsection


.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[point 64]

&gt; We also recognize that urban centres worldwide, especially in developing countries, often have characteristics that make them and their inhabitants especially vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change and other natural and human-made hazards, 

&gt; **including earthquakes, extreme weather events, flooding, subsidence, storms, including dust and sand storms, heatwaves, water scarcity, droughts, water and air pollution, vector-borne diseases and sea level rise,**

&gt; which particularly affect coastal areas, delta regions and small island developing States, among others.
]

.panel[.panel-name[point 65]

&gt; We commit ourselves to facilitating the 

&gt; **sustainable management of natural resources in cities and human settlements in a manner that protects and improves the urban ecosystem and environmental services, reduces greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution and promotes disaster risk reduction and management**, 

&gt;by supporting the development of disaster risk reduction strategies and periodical assessments of disaster risk caused by natural and human-made hazards, including standards for risk levels..
]

.panel[.panel-name[point 67]

  &gt;We commit ourselves to promoting the creation and maintenance of well-connected and well distributed networks of 
  
  &gt; **open, multipurpose, safe, inclusive, accessible, green and quality public spaces, to improving the resilience of cities to disasters and climate change, including floods, drought risks and heat waves**
  
  &gt;  to improving food security and nutrition, physical and mental health, and household and ambient air quality, to reducing noise and promoting attractive and liveable cities, human settlements and urban landscapes and to prioritizing the conservation of endemic

.panel[.panel-name[Data 11.5]
* 11.5.1 (and .2) Data provider at national level is appointed Sendai Framework Focal Points. In most countries disaster **data are collected by line ministries and national disaster loss databases are established and managed by special purpose agencies including national disaster management agencies, civil protection agencies, and meteorological agencies**. The Sendai Framework Focal Points in each country are responsible of data reporting through the Sendai Framework Monitoring System.

* 11.5.3 National disaster loss database, reported to UNISDR...**Not every country has a comparable national disaster loss database that is consistent with these guidelines** (although current coverage exceeds 89 countries). Therefore, by 2020, it is expected that all countries will build/adjust national disaster loss databases according to the recommendations and guidelines by the OEIWG.

.panel[.panel-name[Target 11.7]

By 2030, provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public spaces, in particular for women and children, older persons and persons with disabilities

* Indicator 11.7.1: Average share of the built-up area of cities that is open space for public use for all, by sex, age and persons with disabilities

&gt; Satellite imagery (open sources), documentation outlining publicly owned land and community-based maps are the main sources of data.

But...EO is included...

&gt; High resolution satellite imagery or Google Earth imagery can be used in this analysis. Open data sources such as OpenStreetMap (OSM) have some polygon data on open spaces in many cities

]

.panel[.panel-name[Target 11.6]

By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management

* Indicator 11.6.2: Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (e.g. PM2.5 and PM10) in cities (population weighted)

&gt; Sources of data include ground measurements from monitoring networks, collected for 3,000 cities and localities (WHO 2016) around the world, satellite remote sensing, population estimates...

&gt; estimated with improved modelling using data integration from satellite remote sensing, population estimates, topography and ground measurements (WHO, 2016a; Shaddick et al, 2016)

* The paper by Shaddick is hard to follow with no code.

**Increasing efficiency and resilience**

* These environmental threats are real and present, and London must be prepared for them. London’s homes and infrastructure must be protected against the increasing likelihood of heatwaves, and developments must plan for a more integrated approach to water management, while minimising flood risk.


**Policy SI 12 Flood risk management **

* Development Plans should use the Mayor’s Regional Flood Risk Appraisal and their Strategic Flood Risk Assessment as well as Local Flood Risk Management Strategies, where necessary, to identify areas where particular and cumulative flood risk issues exist and develop actions and policy
approaches aimed at reducing these risks.

# Local policy documents

In most of the previous examples the documents were created by the metropolitan government:
  * Greater London Authority 
  * Amdavad Municipal Corporation
  * City of New York

Usually these are considered an upper tier

They set the strategic plan for the city and may have other responsibilities such as fire, policing, transport and development guidelines.

Lower tier government then carries out or adheres to these goals, for example....

* The Western Australian Planning Commission sets the statutory planning guidance that is carried out by local cities, such as the City of Perth and City of Fremantle.

* The Greater London Authority set the strategic goals for London with London Boroughs providing local services.

# Local policy documents 2

**BUT** there are variations to this rule..

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[City of Cape Town]

* The City of Cape Town is a metropolitan municipality or Category A municipality, there is no local municipality below it.

* However, **above** the City of Cape Town is the Provincial government that is responsible for topics such as: agriculture, education, health and public housing. As such the City sets it's own development plan and then implements it (whilst adhering to relevant Provincial topics).

]

.panel[.panel-name[New York]


* City of New York is responsible for public education, correctional institutions, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services

* 5 Boroughs under it act as spokespeople

* City Council has 51 members from districts of about 157,000 
* New York City is responsible for setting and enacting the policy. State government is above it.

# Summary

* Wide variety of EO data that could be used

* Some studies fail to integrate their outputs with requirements of local areas, governments or cities with generic statements

* What use is it?

* Cities set policies but often focus on legislation or monitoring as opposed to prevention....

* How can we achieve their goals and improve urban areas more effectively in a data informed manner ?
